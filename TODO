better organize loan templates
    let users upload loan templates and then use them to create loan
        for each loan templates generate a overlay with coords for fields
            merge both overlay and templates then print directly using cups or win32print
                or generate pdf and print using cups or win32print


s3 for files storage
pg schema clone 

release update need to be fixed
before print alert user if loanvalue is zero
